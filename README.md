# GaussianPlume
"GaussianPlume" is a project to visualize effect of toxic release in any area through Gaussian dispersion model.
The simulation is available at http://GaussianPlume.github.io/?wd=0/ws=5/Q=10000/lat=23/lon=91.3 where
wd is wind direction, ws is wind speed, Q is amount of material released and lat,lon are latitude and longitude respectively.
One can vary the values of wd,ws,Q,lat and lon according to their need.

Assumptions:
The following assumptions were used to make the simulation.

1. Steady-state conditions, which imply that the rate of emission from the point source is constant. </br>
</br>
2. Wind speed is constant both in time and with height (wind direction shear is not considered).</br>
</br>
3. Mass is conserved through reflection at surfaces.</br>
</br>
4. The model should be applied for average wind speeds of more than 1 m/s (> 1 m/s).</br>
</br>
5. The terrain underlying the plume is flat.</br>
